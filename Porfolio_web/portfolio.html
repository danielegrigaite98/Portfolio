                            This task was one of the most challenging tasks that I have ever had to make. It was my first time ever that I had to code a website using html and css since I’ve never worked with these languages before. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge in the short period of time. The development of the website started with the basics and ended up with way more difficult implementations such as grid layout. That was one of the hardest things I had to learn and had most difficulties with, but apart from that I was able to get a good knowledge for the basics for the web development in order to create something better in the upcoming future. </p>

                        In this task we were required to collect different types of data using different types of methods such as Desk Research, Observation research and Interview research in order to learn the important part - the basics, the selection of UX methods.
                        <h3 class="task_info">What I learned</h3>
                        <p class="theme3_text">In this task I was able to learn different methods of collecting data, how do the methods differ and their benefits for the research purposes. In the Desk research I was able to learn how to collect given information on the existing research whether it’s on the internet or in the book. I was able to notice latest trends in industry and main insight about the topic. The observation research I found very interesting since it was my first time observing the surroundings and coming up with the final results. I was going with the thick descriptions making it very clear and a little bit exaggerated. For the interview research I wasn’t introduced for the first time. I was very aware on how to make the speaker feel comfortable when making the interview.I began the interview with more easy, open questions making the interviewer feel comfortable and just later on ended everything with much deeper questions to really get the best insights from the person.

We had to design a specific website prototype during the sprint week using all the knowledge needed for the best user experience when visiting the website.

The importance of the copy and microcopy, to use “ The think about test” in order to see the failures and the stuff that have worked and that needed to be improved. I also learned how to use an XD adobe programme which made the work progress way easier and applicable. Remembering the work group, it was very hard to communicate with everyone and come up with the final design for the website since after the research done </p>

                        We were given a group and we had to build and test a realistic prototype in five days. We had a task to come up with the problem and a solution for it. In our group we came up the main problem among the students which was relatable for all of us students - how can we monitise and share our knowledge and find jobs quickly with the knowledge that we have.

                            On this project I got very lucky with my group because we were able to come up with planning and solutions very fast. I’ve got to experience the mapping of the problem and the learning process of developing an app idea for the topic that we have picked our selfs which was “monetising your knowledge”. During the sprint week we got to go through different sprint days which were responsible for different plannings like:
                            Map - mapping the problems and ideas, writing all thoughts that come in mind for the problem that we had. When sketching, I’ve learned how difficult it is to draw your thoughts on the piece of paper in order for the person to understand your exact idea. After we sketched down everything , it was time to decide . We decided with the main idea, the goal and who’s is going to be responsible for what.Personally , myself, I got to be a facilitator so I was responsible for the time management and the documentation. Next came Type. We got to do our prototype for the app on the Adobe XD which later we got to test it ourselves and people that have been asked to on the iPhones using the link. Even after the test , we mananged to improve it and learn from the mistakes that user has encountered with. </p>

                            In this assignment, I’ve learned a lot about design , firstly creating it on a peace of paper by making sketched and then making it become real , making a turn around by using Adobe illustrator. I started by sketching my background on the piece of paper together with the character on it. After that I started drawing a flat design of the character in the illustrator. I chose flat design for my character because I found it more aesthetic for the website and easier to illustrate. I also chose to make it in a colourful theme to give the user a feeling of positive and good appearance. The most important thing that I've learned and have never done it before was how to make design sprite using illustrator since it's the only way you can make your image move using different shots of movement.</p>

                                This task was one of the most interesting ones since I was able to animate something that I’ve created and designed on my own.I’ve really got to turn my imagination and use it for something that would come true.Firstly, I got to sketch something on the piece of paper and pick the final sketch in order for me to draw it on the Adobe Illustrator. I learned how to work with illustrator, how to different shots, how to create your own character and a background for it. For the animation itself for it to be able to work I was introduced to something new a way difficult than ever - Java Script. For my animation to be able to work I had to not only use html and css , but also use java script since it’s responsible for the animations behaviour. I got to make my animated character to move in different ways like for example - shake, jump, spin etc. by using different variables and funcions such as ( ). I was also able to learn how to add a sound into my animations buttons by using function playSound().In general,I’ve had some difficulties understanding the language and how it works, but at the end I’ve managed to work it out.

I got to learn new effects on the editing part, how to make the screen split into two parts, how to manage music and know that the permission is necessary to use in order for the audio to be legal.

I learned that not only we had to draw down the sketches, but we also had to write down the time laps and the frames, in order for us to know the approximate time for the video and how the camera should be places in order to get the best shots. </p>

                            After the website has been made, now we had to present the final product in the pitch form for the company. </p>
                            <h3 class="task_info">What I learned</h3>
                         <p class="theme3_text">  <p class="theme3_text"> This wasn’t my first time doing the pitch, but as soon as we got a chance to do another one, I was able to learn and take more information and experience from it. I got to learn the right structure for the pitch by simply having three main questions such as “ who?how?why?“ Apart from that,I also learned how to talk to the audience, got some courage to do that ,how to catch their attention and make it interesting for everyone. I learned that the best way is to have interesting and catchy questions in the begging of the presentation. I’ve learned that a good pitch has to have some sort of story line. After we managed to present, I felt like I’ve grown as a student more and that it can get easier and easier as long as you practice it.   </p>
