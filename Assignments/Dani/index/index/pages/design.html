                other color, it can be used as a very good color match for the

    <h2> Typography </h2>

    <p> The post modernist movement was a large influence for
        typography. Through rebellion, technology advances and
        new art styles, new typefaces were created. The ideas from
        the post modernist movement were non traditional, rebellious,
        and abstract. This is reflected in the new digital, and
        abstract typefaces that came out of this period. In the end,
        through technologies and art innovations, new typefaces
        were bold, innovative, and for the first time, digital. Thanks
        to the post modernist movement.
        Typography that I have chosen for my website is called “ Barlow
        Condensed” . I chose this style in specific because it’s assoasiated
        with innovations and modernism.</p>

    <center>
        <img src="../images/font_title.png" alt="profile" height="50" class="title">
    </center>
    <p> For the text I chose typography with the weight of the style that is not too light and not too heavy,it’s
        medium and perfect for the website's articles. I also chose this shift because it’s in San Sirif
        style,which means it’s more modern and not so “old style”.</p>

        <img src="../images/font_numbers.png" alt="profile" height="60" class="title">
    </center>
    <p> The numbers are also presented in a very modern structure.
        What makes the shift so modern is the lenght, which is
        very vertical and the widght, which is very standart and
        not so wide, which again,makes it more simplistic,rather than it
        being very wide,making it look more heavier.</p>

    <p> For the Display I chose the same font ,but in different boldness to make it stand out more.There re different weights for boldness,but I chose to pick the "medium bold" and </p>
