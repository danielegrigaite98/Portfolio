			<h2> About Me</h2>
    			<p> I am a 21 year old student from Lithuania, currently studying Multimedia Design at KEA - the Copenhagen’s School of Design and Technology in Copenhagen,Denmark. I chose Multimedia Design at KEA because it’s a subject that is very potential in todays world and especially in the upcoming future. So far, I’m enjoying my time at KEA because I am able to express myself through different kinds of forms of creativity. I am taught to design and code the websites, create various animations, work with numerous programmes/apps that I have never touched before. Not only am I able to express myself through the Digital world , but I am also able to improve my communication skills through creating and completing users needs that require you to communicate in the right way in order for the user to be understood in the correct way leaving him feeling content.</p>

			<h2> Personal life</h2>

        		 <p>Apart from the studies, I also work in the cafe where I get to serve the brunch and socialise with different people. On my free time I usually tend to spend it with my friends , explore beautiful places in Copenhagen, cook something with the loved ones and I try my best to learn something new each day.</p>

       			 <h2> My Past </h2>
        		 <p> My hometown is a small place located in the centre of Europe. I was originally born in the capital of Lithuania - Vilnius, but my whole life I was travelling around the world because of my parent’s job. I got to live some time in Moscow, Russia and later on in Stockholm, Sweden. I couldn’t be any more happier to have these opportunities in my life. Because of them I got to experience different cultures, learn new languages and meet a lot of new people. </p>
