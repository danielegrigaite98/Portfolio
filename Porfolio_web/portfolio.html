                        <p>
                            This task was one of the most challenging tasks that I have ever had to make. It was my first time ever that I had to code a website using html and css since I’ve never worked with these languages before. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge in the short period of time. The development of the website started with the basics and ended up with way more difficult implementations such as grid layout. That was one of the hardest things I had to learn and had most difficulties with, but apart from that I was able to get a good knowledge for the basics for the web development in order to create something better in the upcoming future. </p>

                        In this task we were required to collect different types of data using different types of methods such as Desk Research, Observation research and Interview research in order to learn the important part - the basics, the selection of UX methods.
                        <h3 class="task_info">What I learned</h3>
                        <p class="theme3_text">In this task I was able to learn different methods of collecting data, how do the methods differ and their benefits for the research purposes. In the Desk research I was able to learn how to collect given information on the existing research whether it’s on the internet or in the book. I was able to notice latest trends in industry and main insight about the topic. The observation research I found very interesting since it was my first time observing the surroundings and coming up with the final results. I was going with the thick descriptions making it very clear and a little bit exaggerated. For the interview research I wasn’t introduced for the first time. I was very aware on how to make the speaker feel comfortable when making the interview.I began the interview with more easy, open questions making the interviewer feel comfortable and just later on ended everything with much deeper questions to really get the best insights from the person.

                        For this assignment we were dived into groups for us to create a website prototype for the provider of the site is the Danish government - the Ministry of Higher Education and Science which should include the conventions of real estate-, job portal- and dating sites. We had to design a specific website prototype during the sprint week using all the knowledge needed for the best user experience when visiting the website.

                        <p class="theme3_text">
                            I was able to learn the understanding of the good website making, what’s comfortable and what is not for the user. The importance of the copy and microcopy, to use “ The think about test” in order to see the failures and the stuff that have worked and that needed to be improved. I also learned how to use an XD adobe programme which made the work progress way easier and applicable. Remembering the work group, it was very hard to communicate with everyone and come up with the final design for the website since after the research done </p>
