                    <p> Welcome to my first ever website! This website is based on KEA’s Multimedia Design first year programme. Students job was to create a website using two of the core technologies - one of them being html and other css. We had to create them based on a given movement style and get inspired by it for your own ,future website. The movement style that I got was Post-modernism. It’s a movement style that I have heard about before , but never got to explore it . Happy to say that I got to know it better due to this task :) I had a lot of fun doing this task, even though it wasn't very easy since everything was very new to me,but I hope I managed for it to work!I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I did creating it!</p>
