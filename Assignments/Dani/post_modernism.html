    <h2> History</h2>

    <p> PostModernism is a movement or in other words - a method
        of philosophical thoughts that gained widespread acceptance
        in the late 1970s and was born in response to modernism.
        Before it all appeared, everything started from the modern
        movement which was born at the age of reason and logic
        and took it to a whole new step.People became bored of connecting
        everything with their religion and old traditions and
        began to expand their knowledge up to a new level.That’s
        when the whole “American Dream” concept gained lots of
        attention. But later on,people realised, that institutions that
        would progress into the future are just as likely to destroy
        everything.And that’s when postmodernism appears. There
        was no longer unified system, no longer institutional system,
        structure, everything came with endless choice, different/
        own meanings, identities and that’s part of the reason,why
        in today’s world it’s hard to define the movement rejecting
        ideas.</p>

    <h2>Definition </h2>
    <p> People usually get very confused with terminology postmodernism and what it actually is and very often mix it up with modernism. But in true words, no one has ever identified it in a perfect way.Postmodernism does not replace modernism, both of them coexist. The style does not reject everything,it questions everything.Postmodernism is a very general and wide-ranging term which is applied to literature, art, philosophy, architecture, fiction, and cultural and literary criticism, among others. Postmodernism is largely a reaction to the assumptions of scientific, or objective efforts to explain reality. It stems from a recognition that reality is not simply mirrored in human understanding of it, but rather, is constructed as the mind tries to understand its own particular and personal reality. Associated with “anything goes” pluralism, fragmentation, allusions, allegory and quotations, postmodernism will remain vague, since those who claim to be postmodernists have varying beliefs and opinions on issues.

    <h2> Characteristics</h2>

    <p> When listing the characteristics of postmodernism, it is important
        to remember that postmodernists do not place their philosophy
        in a defined box or category. As mentioned before ,their
        beliefs and practices are personal rather than being identifiable
        with a particular establishment or special interest group.
        There are many characteristics of postmodernism, such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Self-conceptualization and rationalization</li>
        <li> Truth and error are synonymous</li>
        <li>Ownership </li>
        <li>Morality is personal </li>
        <li>Morality is personal </li>
        <li>Globalization </li>
        <li> Liberal ethics</li>
        <li>Disillusionment with modernism </li>

    <h2> Famous artist </h2>
    <p> In todays world, there are many famous artist representing postmodernism using combination of style elements from the past, such as the classical and the baroque, but also popular films and magazines, and apply them to spare modern forms, often with ironic effect.</p>
    <h3> Andy Warhol </h3>
    <p> <q> People's opinions are torn over whether this is genious and a creative new idea for the postmodern age, or whether it is a load of rubbish. Others believe that pop art is worth way more that it is worth to look at.</q> Pop art is post modern as it has created a new version of art which is original and new, as well as combining both high art with low art. Andy Warhol's art work is post modern as it uses bricolage to combine both images and writing within artwork.One of the famous art pieces being "10 marylins"</p>

    <h3> Roy Lichtenstein</h3>
    <p> Roy Lichtenstein was one of the first American Pop artists to achieve widespread renown, and he became a lightning rod for criticism of the movement. His early work ranged widely in style and subject matter, and displayed considerable understanding of postmodernist painting: Lichtenstein would often maintain that he was as interested in the abstract qualities of his images as he was in their subject matter. </p>
