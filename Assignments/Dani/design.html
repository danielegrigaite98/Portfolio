                White color - to keep the backround neautral,simple and
                have a standart base for text and visuals to make them more
                visible and clear

            <p>
                Dark blue - I chose a darkblue color that could almost be
                compared to pure black color, just didn’t want it to be too basic.
                This color might be used for the text shift, in order for the text to
                be more visible on the light backround.

            <h2> #D1DAFF</h2>
            <p>
                Light purple/gray - I chose this color because it creates a
                good color match and contrast between all the others.Since grey
                undertones are usually very neautral and don’t usually affect
                other color, it can be used as a very good color match for the
                whole view in general( in this case,the whole website theme)

                Yellow - thats the color I chose to be the brightest one and
                bring some dimension to the website.When choosing it, I
                also picked the coolest undertone to match the other. Since
                yellow color is usually assosiated with light and happiness
                , I thought it would be perfect in the whole mixture of the
                three other cool toned colors.

        <h2> Typography </h2>

        <p> The post modernist movement was a large influence for
            typography. Through rebellion, technology advances and
            new art styles, new typefaces were created. The ideas from
            the post modernist movement were non traditional, rebellious,
            and abstract. This is reflected in the new digital, and
            abstract typefaces that came out of this period. In the end,
            through technologies and art innovations, new typefaces
            were bold, innovative, and for the first time, digital. Thanks
            to the post modernist movement.
            Typography that I have chosen for my website is called “ Barlow
            Condensed” . I chose this style in specific because it’s assoasiated
            with innovations and modernism.For my whole website I chose the same Typeface which has a large family of variations ,different boldness,making the display's and body'stext differ a little but not so much that it wouldn't be possible to recognise.</p>

    <div class="col_6">
        
 
    
    <p> For the text I chose typography with the weight of the style that is not too light and not too heavy,it’s
        medium and perfect for the website's articles. I also chose this shift because it’s in San Sirif
        style,which means it’s more modern and not so “old style”.The shift it self is very think and long in leght which goes perfectly with the theme of the website.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="../Dani/img/display_examples.png" alt="display_font" height="180" class="title">
    </div>
    <p> For the Display I chose the same font ,but in different boldness to make it stand out more.There are different weights for boldness,but I chose to pick the "medium bold" for bigget titles, which mainly is my home page title and "semi bold" for the smaller titles making them not so exagerated.I don't have the small titles on my website yet, but I'm planning on applying this font for the part which goes after the display's main title. </p>

                <p>For the final icon I wanted to created somehting with the word <q>Multi</q> but with a bit of touch to make it more unique.I've decided to make the letter <q>L</q> from <q>multi</q> as a symbol in the middle of the word.I also wanted a contrast between white and black colors, so I made the letter in color white with the black outline and the sign in the middle in the color black. </p>

<!--    </center>-->

  
    <div class="center">
        <p> For the final logo I chose a very minimalistic and simple version.After sketching many other logos,I've decided that I want a simple version for my icon, because it would go very nicely with my websites whole look and would'nt be the most exagerated thing on it. I was contemplating wheter I should make it bold or simple, but I chose making it more bold in order for it not to bled with my body's text and stand out more.The logo represents the capital <q> M</q> for <q> multimedia </q> and capital <q> D </q> for my name, which is Daniele.Underneath letter <q> M</q> I made a stand from two black lines to make it more interesting and make it seem more valuable from the designers perspective.
